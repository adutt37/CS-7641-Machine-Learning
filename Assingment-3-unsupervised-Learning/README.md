Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.

Required libraries may include pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and others. You can install any missing dependencies 
using pip install -r requirements.txt if a requirements file is provided.
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/adutt37/CS-7641-Machine-Learning.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd CS-7641-Machine-Learning/Assignment-3-unsupervised-Learning
Dataset Preparation:
Ensure the necessary datasets (phishing_web.csv and bank.csv) are placed in the root directory of this project. These files are required to run the scripts effectively.

Running the Scripts
To execute the unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction methods, follow these steps:

Run the main Python script:

python unsupervised_learning.py
This script applies the selected unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction techniques to the datasets and generates insights on their computational and predictive qualities.

Project Structure
unsupervised_learning.py - Main script to perform unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction.
phishing_web.csv - Dataset on phishing websites.
bank.csv - Dataset on bank customer data.

Results
The script will output evaluations for each unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction method, highlighting computational efficiency and predictive performance.

Overview
This repository contains implementations of optimization algorithms using the mlrose_hiive library. The code includes solutions for the Knapsack problem, N-Queens problem, and neural network training with various optimization strategies:

Randomized Hill Climbing (RHC)
Simulated Annealing (SA)
Genetic Algorithm (GA)
MIMIC (Mutual Information Maximizing Input Clustering)

Requirements
To run the code, install the following Python packages:
pip install mlrose-hiive numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

Run the Knapsack algorithms with the following command:
execute file py knapsack_random_search_algo.py

Run the N-queen algorithms with the following command:
execute file py nqueens_random_search_algo.py

Run the neural network algorithm with the following commands:
py GA_phishing.py
py RHC_phishing.py
py SA_phishing.py
phishing_classification_sa_rhc_ga.py
